# neo4j-cypher
#### A Neo4j driver for making Cypher queries over HTTP
Indexing and mass property updates can't be done with pure Cypher yet, so the library provides HTTP API wrappers for these functions. Currently compatible with Neo4j 1.8M06 and up.

## Install
```bash
npm install neo4j-cypher
```

## Usage
Coming soon...
